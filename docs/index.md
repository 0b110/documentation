# RetroShare Documentation

---

## Installation

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site
generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation
source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML
configuration file.

### Compilation

MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages,
Amazon S3, or [anywhere][deploy] else you choose.
